React Binden (Binden is a German word meaning Bind in English) is just a simple form handling like other one's. But it simplifies the form-handling in react more than ever. Instead of being based on only hooks/HOC or only custom components, react-binden uses both hooks & custom components to provide the best possible developer experience without compromising the performance & safety. Btw, it's **the most lightweight** one weighing only around **4.4KB** ([bundlephobia.com](https://bundlephobia.com/package/react-binden@latest)) which even has it's **own validation system** integrated

Integrating an form-library with a third-party UI component library was never as easy as now. _React Binden doesn't even require a 3rd-party library to integrate itself with other UI Frameworks/Libraries_. You can do it pretty easily in [here](/docs/tutorials/3rd-party-ui-libraries)

## Features of React Binden:

-   Inspired from Vue's `v-bind` directive aka bind-variable API
-   Easy, simple & Complete control over React form, input, validation & submission
-   Most lightweight react form library (only 4.4KB)ðŸª¶, fastâš¡ & uses ESNext module system (tree-shakable)ðŸŒ²
-   Offers validation out of the box. Doesn't even require one to install 3rd validation library
-   Useful Regex Collection for validation out of the boxðŸ¤¯
-   Provides own hooks & components to build the form
-   zero dependency (only 3 peerDependencies: react, react-dom & prop-types)ðŸ‘€
-   Field imprinting (a way to follow another field's value completely like ducklings follows duckðŸ¦†)
-   UI component library/framework proofðŸ˜‰
-   Easy to understand codebase if you want contribute to itðŸ’š
