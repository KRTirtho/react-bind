# react-bind

A **two-way binding** React form handling library with semantic validation

Its a lightweight form library & provides simple APIs to handle `input`s & `textarea`s. Validates forms with both semantic validation & manual validation for unique styles. Supports **field-imprinting** (a system where a field follows another field's value for match. e.g Confirm Password & Password field) & handles form submission/reset
